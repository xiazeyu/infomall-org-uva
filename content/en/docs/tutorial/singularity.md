## Singularity

Singularity is a container runtime that implements a unique security model to 
mitigate privilege escalation risks and provides a platform to capture a complete 
application environment into a single file (SIF).

Singularity is often used in HPC centers.

UNiversity of Virginia unfortunately does not allow us to access the full singularity features 
and only allows us to access a single specific command to create images.

If you need more features, please submit a ticket to the Rivanna help team with the missing 
feature you need so they can enable it for you.

We discuss here how to build and run singularity images.



### build.def

To build an image you will need a build definition file 

We show next an exxample of a simple `buid.def` file that uses internally a [NVIDIA NGC PyTorch container](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/pytorch).

```
Bootstrap: docker
From: nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:23.02-py3
```

Next you can follow the steps that are detailed in 
<https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/3.7/user-guide/definition_files.html#sections>

However, for Rivanna we MUST create the image as discussed next.

### Creating the Singularity Image

In order for you to create a singularity container from the
`build.def` file please login to either of the following special nodes
on Rivanna:

* `biihead1.bii.virginia.edu` 
* `biihead2.bii.virginia.edu`

For example: 

```bash
ssh $USER@biihead1.bii.virginia.edu
```

where $USER is your computing ID on Rivanna.

Now that you are logged in to the special node, you can create the
singularity image with the following command:

```bash
sudo /opt/singularity/3.7.1/bin/singularity build output_image.sif build.def
```

Note: **It is important that you type in only this command. If you modify
the name output_image.sif or build.def the command will not work and you will
recieve an authorization error.**

In case you need to rename the image to a better name please use the `mv` command.


In case you also need to have a different name other then build.def the following commands are recommended. We assime you use `myimage.def` and `myimage.sif`. Bet is to include it into a makefile such as:

```
BUILD=myimage.def
IMAGE=myimage.sif

image:
	cp $BUILD build.def
	sudo /opt/singularity/3.7.1/bin/singularity build output_image.sif build.def
	cp output_image.sif $IMAGE
	make -f clean

clean:
	rm -rf build.def output_image.sif
```

Placing it in a	`Makefile` will now allow you to use the command

```bash
make image
```

and the image `myimage.sif` will be created. with make clean you will
delete the temporary files `build.def and `output_image.sif`
	

### Why NVIDIA NGC?

Because it is tested and guaranteed for reliability and peformance by
NVIDIA, which is the most widely adopted reference environment (base
image) for building images using NVIDIA GPU. Besides PyTorch, it also
provides images for TensorFlow and many HPC applications.

## Work with Singularity container

reference: <https://www.rc.virginia.edu/userinfo/rivanna/software/containers/>


### Run GPU images

To use NVIDIA GPU with Singularity, `--nv` flag is needed.

```basg
singularity exec --nv output_image.sif python myscript.py
```

Since Python is defined as the default command to be excuted and
singularity passes the argument(s) after the image name,
i.e. myscript.py, to the Python interpreter. So the above singularity
command is equivalent to

```bash
singularity run --nv output_image.sif myscript.py
```

### Run Images Interactively

```bash
ijob  -A mygroup -p gpu --gres=gpu -c 1
module purge
module load singularity
singularity shell --nv output_image.sif
```

## Singularity Filesystem on Rivanna

The following paths are exposed to the container by default

* /tmp
* /proc
* /sys
* /dev
* /home
* /scratch
* /nv
* /project

### Adding Custom Bind Paths

For example, the following command adds the /scratch/$USER directory as an overlay without overlaying any other user directories provided by the host:

```bash
singularity run -c -B /scratch/$USER output_image.sif
```

To add the /home directory on the host as /rivanna/home inside the container:

```bash
singularity run -c -B /home:/rivanna/home output_image.sif
```
